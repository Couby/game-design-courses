My answers to questions.

> From the previous assignment, what peer feedback did you find the most useful, and how did you use this knowledge into your new game? Specifically, how have you used peer feedback to improve your game design? Be descriptive!

* The V1 was a bit too simple. I find the recommendation about adding more pieces to collect accurate. And finally I agree with the idea that the  organization of the page could be a bit confusing.
* So I modified the gameplay to replace the ring by a labyrinth. The former gameplay was only based on hazard, now the player competence is also part of it.
* And I reorganized a little bit the page so I think it should be less confusing.

> Describe how you articulated the rules in your game. Specifically, have you used documentation, narration, or in-game discovery? Using your previous game as a point of comparison, how has your approach to game rules, instructions, or gameplay improved the balance or interest in this week's assignment?

* Compared to V1, I added a little story about a robot searching for pieces in order to build a Sumobot. In V1 I was directly talking about collecting pieces.

My answers to questions.

> From the previous assignment, what peer feedback did you find the most useful, and how did you use this knowledge into your new game? Specifically, how have you used peer feedback to improve your game design? Be descriptive!

* The most useful feedbacks I think were those about some aspects of rules I didn't mention : which directions for moves, picking pieces landing on tiles or passing over.
I added simple explanations to answer these details.

> Give your peer reviewers some context. Describe the narrative elements you have added to this game. Is your game writer-driven, writer-led, or player-led? What elements in the game support the approach you have used?

* There were already a story with A2002. I tried to improve it a little bit adding a goal for A2002.
This is clearly writer-driven. There are just some context elements in order to give a more compelling goal. The story goal is linked to the game goal making all coherent.

*After week 2 I forgot to make screens about peer reviews :-(. And it is not available once the course has ended...*

I missed to report my answers and feedback. I added small bot tiles to steal pieces. Feedback was good :-).


## Story and Narrative Development for Video Games

### Break
I lacked of time to resume this course. Having simultaneously the two courses at the end was too much.
Maybe I'll resume here at a next session...
