> Write a short statement that describes your interest to this story/movie, or rather: Why does this story matter to you? (100 words)

When I was young, that film motivated me becoming pilot in the Air Force.
Beside the action and call to excellence, the spine of this story fueled my determination and taught me that good or bad there's always something to learn from what we have to face. Nearly 30 years after, I can say that's right.
